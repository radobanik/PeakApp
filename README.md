### 2. Backend Setup

Navigate to the backend directory:

```bash
cd apps/backend

```

Create a `.env` file based on `.env.example`:

```bash
cp .env.example .env

```

Fill in the required environment variables:

```env
# Database
POSTGRES_USER=your_db_user
POSTGRES_PASSWORD=your_db_password
POSTGRES_DB=peak_app_db

# JWT
JWT_SECRET=your_jwt_secret

# AWS S3
AWS_S3_BUCKET_NAME=your_bucket_name
AWS_S3_REGION=your_region
AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=your_access_key
AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=your_secret_key

# PgAdmin (optional)
PGADMIN_DEFAULT_EMAIL=admin@admin.com
PGADMIN_DEFAULT_PASSWORD=admin

# Email (Resend)
RESEND_API_KEY=your_resend_api_key

```

### 3. Install Dependencies

From the root directory:

```bash
npm install --legacy-peer-deps

```

### 4. Start Database

```bash
docker compose up -d

```

This will start:

-   PostgreSQL database on port 5432
-   PgAdmin on port 5050

### 5. Run Database Migrations

```bash
cd apps/backend
npm run migrate

```

### 6. Initialize Data

For mock data:

```bash
npm run init-data

```

Or import real data from Toplogger:

```bash
npm run import-toplogger

```

### 7. Start Development Servers

From the root directory:

```bash
npm run dev

```

This will start:

-   Backend API on `http://localhost:8080`
-   Frontend app on `http://localhost:5173`

Or start them individually:

```bash
npm run dev:backend  # Backend only
npm run dev:frontend # Frontend only

```

### Linting & Formatting

```bash
npm run lint          # Check for linting errors
npm run lint:fix      # Fix linting errors
npm run prettier      # Check formatting
npm run prettier:fix  # Fix formatting
npm run format        # Fix both linting and formatting

```

##  Authentication

The application uses JWT-based authentication with the following roles:

-   **USER** - Standard user with access to basic features
-   **ADMIN** - Administrative access with content moderation capabilities

### Default Admin Account (after init-data)

```

Password: password123

```

## API Documentation

The backend includes Swagger API documentation. After starting the backend, visit:

```
http://localhost:8080/api-docs
